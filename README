To compile and run project:
> make
> ./oss [-h -t -s -n]


Example runs
With defaults: 
> ./oss

With args:
> ./oss -n 5 -s 2 -t 4


Notes:
No options are required. Default argument for n and s is 1, default argument for t is 3.
Program runs as expected and user argument values are not limited in this version.


Problems encountered during development:
During implementation I encountered issues with implementing pcb.h and pcb.c in oss.c. 
pcb.h and .c were developed and tested separately from main program, to simplify the testing process.
When functions were added to oss, I unintentially created an infinite loop. I reverted back to 
the original working version of oss and implemented each PCB feature individually for incremental testing
--the issue turned out to be my decision to place the process table updates inside of the child process.
But since I had already removed most of the functions from the program, I kept the variable counters for 
this version. In future projects I will probably reincorperatate the functions I created for pcb operations.
