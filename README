To compile and run project:
> make
> ./oss [-h -t -s -n]


Example runs
With defaults: 
> ./oss

With args:
> ./oss -n5 -s2 -t2


Notes:
No options are required. Default argument for all options is 1.
Program runs as expected and user is limited to argument values not greater than 10.


Problems encountered during development:
When trying to implement the -s simul restriction I had some trouble launching the 
worker sets reliably. I also had some trouble with the parent terminating before the
childern finished launching.

After some rearranging I implemented a for loop in oss.c (lines 80 - 82) to ensure the 
parent would wait until every batch of workers was launched.
